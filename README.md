# Summary

This is a basic GO API I've made to be able to upload music, retrieve it, and play it from any client.

### Current and Future Features

1. To be able to upload music or create an artist record users need to sign up be logged in.
2. Music can still be retrieved with authentication.
3. API Only working locally at the moment due to audio files only being stored in a local folder.
4. I will be moving the storage of audio files to AWS S3 once I get more comfortable with GO and get the API working smoothly locally.
   * This will not be hard as I've done this multiple times in the past, I am not doing it now because it is not worth the cost of bandwidth.
5. This API is also able to extra the colors of images (album covers).
   * I want to use this to replicate the YouTube's ambient mode.
